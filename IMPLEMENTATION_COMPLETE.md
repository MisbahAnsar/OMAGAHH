## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Before (What you had):
```
User bets 0.1 SOL
  ↓
Fake animation plays
  ↓
Balance doesn't change ❌
```

### After (What you have now):
```
User bets 0.1 SOL
  ↓
REAL transaction sent to blockchain
  ↓
Smart contract receives 0.1 SOL
  ↓
Game plays (provably fair random)
  ↓
WIN: Smart contract sends back 0.195 SOL ✅
LOSE: Smart contract keeps the 0.1 SOL ❌
  ↓
Balance updates automatically!
```

## 🚀 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Install Solana CLI (Windows)

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
cmd /c "curl https://release.solana.com/v1.17.0/solana-install-init-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe --output C:\solana-install-tmp\solana-install-init.exe --create-dirs && C:\solana-install-tmp\solana-install-init.exe v1.17.0"

# Add to PATH (follow installer instructions)

# Verify
solana --version
```

### Step 2: Setup Wallet

```bash
# Configure for devnet
solana config set --url devnet

# Create/use wallet
solana-keygen new

# Get test SOL (repeat 3-5 times)
solana airdrop 2
solana airdrop 2
solana airdrop 2

# Verify
solana balance  # Should show 6+ SOL
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install @project-serum/anchor @solana/web3.js
```

### Step 4: Build & Deploy Smart Contract

**Option A: Use Anchor (if installed)**
```bash
cd programs/casino
anchor build
anchor deploy
```

**Option B: Manual deployment**
```bash
cd programs/casino
cargo build-bpf
solana program deploy target/deploy/casino.so
```

**Get the Program ID from the output!**

### Step 5: Update Program ID

Update in these files:

**1. `programs/casino/src/lib_simple.rs`** (line 7)
```rust
declare_id!("YOUR_PROGRAM_ID_HERE");
```

**2. `src/lib/casino-program.ts`** (line 8)
```typescript
export const CASINO_PROGRAM_ID = new PublicKey('YOUR_PROGRAM_ID_HERE');
```

### Step 6: Initialize Casino

```bash
node scripts/init-casino.js
```

This creates the casino account (one-time setup).

### Step 7: Fund the Vault

```bash
node scripts/fund-vault.js
```

This puts 2 SOL in the vault so it can pay winners!

### Step 8: Test It!

```bash
# Start the app
npm run dev

# Open browser: http://localhost:5174
# Connect wallet
# Go to games
# Place a bet!
```

## 🎮 Testing the Implementation

### Test 1: Small Bet

1. Go to Coin Flip
2. Bet **0.01 SOL**
3. Choose Heads or Tails
4. Click FLIP
5. **Approve transaction** in wallet
6. Wait for confirmation
7. **Check your balance** - it changed!

### Test 2: View Transaction

1. After betting, go to: https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet
2. Paste your wallet address
3. You'll see:
   - Your bet transaction
   - The payout (if you won)
   - All on-chain!

### Test 3: Multiple Games

Try all three games:
- **Coin Flip** - 50/50 chance, 1.95x payout
- **Dice Roll** - Variable odds, up to 9.8x
- **Slots** - 3 reels, up to 25x jackpot!

---

## 💰 How the Games Work

### Coin Flip
```
Bet: 0.1 SOL
Choice: Heads

WIN (Heads) → Get 0.195 SOL back
LOSE (Tails) → Lose 0.1 SOL

Net if win: +0.095 SOL ✅
Net if lose: -0.1 SOL ❌
```

### Dice Roll
```
Bet: 0.1 SOL
Prediction: Roll > 3

Result: 5 → WIN!
Payout: Variable based on odds

Multiple betting options!
```

### Slots
```
Bet: 0.1 SOL
3 Reels spin...

7-7-7 → Jackpot! 25x (2.5 SOL)
X-X-X → Three of a kind: 10x (1 SOL)
X-X-? → Two of a kind: 2x (0.2 SOL)
No match → Lose bet ❌
```

---

## 🔍 Verification

### How to Verify It's Working:

1. **Check Balance Before Bet**
   ```bash
   solana balance
   # Example: 10.5 SOL
   ```

2. **Place Bet (0.1 SOL)**

3. **Check Balance After**
   ```bash
   solana balance
   # If won: 10.595 SOL (+0.095 profit)
   # If lost: 10.4 SOL (-0.1 loss)
   ```

4. **View in Solana Explorer**
   - See the actual transactions
   - Verify on-chain
   - View program logs

## 📊 What's Different

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Betting** | Fake | Real SOL |
| **Transactions** | None | On Solana blockchain |
| **Balance** | No change | Actually changes |
| **Wins** | Fake | Real SOL received |
| **Losses** | Fake | Real SOL lost |
| **Verification** | Not possible | Check on explorer |
| **Fairness** | Not provable | Provably fair |

## 🔐 Security Features

### Implemented:
- ✅ Bet limits (min/max)
- ✅ Provably fair randomness
- ✅ House edge (2.5%)
- ✅ Admin controls
- ✅ Vault management

### For Production (Later):
- ⚠️ Proper VRF (Chainlink/Switchboard)
- ⚠️ Security audit
- ⚠️ Emergency pause mechanism
- ⚠️ Advanced access controls

---

## 📝 Important Notes

### Using Devnet:
- ✅ **Free SOL** - unlimited via airdrops
- ✅ **Safe testing** - no real money
- ✅ **Fast transactions** - good for testing
- ✅ **Public explorer** - verify everything

### About Randomness:
- Current implementation uses slot hash
- Good for devnet testing
- For mainnet, use Chainlink VRF or Switchboard

### Transaction Fees:
- Each bet costs ~0.000005 SOL transaction fee
- Very cheap on Solana!
- Vault pays winner payouts

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "solana command not found"
**Solution:** Restart terminal or add to PATH

### "Insufficient funds"
**Solution:** 
```bash
solana airdrop 2
```

### "Transaction failed"
**Solution:**
- Check vault has enough SOL
- Verify you're on devnet
- Ensure bet is within limits

### "Program not found"
**Solution:**
- Verify program is deployed
- Check program ID is correct
- Make sure you're on devnet
