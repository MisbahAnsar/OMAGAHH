## 🚀 What YOU Need to Do (Step-by-Step)

### Phase 1: Install Solana (5 minutes)

#### On Windows:
```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
cmd /c "curl https://release.solana.com/v1.17.0/solana-install-init-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe --output C:\solana-install-tmp\solana-install-init.exe --create-dirs && C:\solana-install-tmp\solana-install-init.exe v1.17.0"

# Close and reopen PowerShell, then:
solana --version
```

#### On Mac/Linux:
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.17.0/install)"

# Then:
solana --version
```

---

### Phase 2: Setup Wallet (2 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Set to devnet
solana config set --url devnet

# 2. Create wallet (save the seed phrase!)
solana-keygen new

# 3. Get free test SOL (do this 5 times)
solana airdrop 2
solana airdrop 2
solana airdrop 2
solana airdrop 2
solana airdrop 2

# 4. Verify you have at least 8 SOL
solana balance
```

**Expected output:** `10.0 SOL` (or more)

---

### Phase 3: Install Dependencies (1 minute)

```bash
# From your project root
npm install @project-serum/anchor @solana/web3.js
```

---

### Phase 4: Install Rust & Anchor (10 minutes)

#### Install Rust:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### Install Anchor:
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --locked --force
avm install latest
avm use latest

# Verify
anchor --version
```

---

### Phase 5: Build & Deploy Smart Contract (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Go to casino program directory
cd programs/casino

# 2. Build the program
anchor build

# 3. Get the program ID
solana address -k target/deploy/casino-keypair.json
```

**COPY THIS ADDRESS!** It will look like: `7xQ2DtQ8vK9qXpJqLEQw...`

#### Update Program ID in 2 places:

**File 1: `programs/casino/src/lib_simple.rs` (line 7)**
```rust
declare_id!("PASTE_YOUR_PROGRAM_ID_HERE");
```

**File 2: `src/lib/casino-program.ts` (line 8)**  
```typescript
export const CASINO_PROGRAM_ID = new PublicKey('PASTE_YOUR_PROGRAM_ID_HERE');
```

#### Deploy:
```bash
# Still in programs/casino directory
anchor deploy
```

**Success looks like:**
```
Program Id: 7xQ2DtQ8vK9...

Deploy success!
```

---

### Phase 6: Initialize Casino (1 minute)

```bash
# From project root
node scripts/init-casino.js
```

**Expected output:**
```
🎰 Initializing Casino on Devnet...
✅ Connected to devnet
✅ Loaded wallet: YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
💰 Balance: 10 SOL
🚀 Initializing casino...
✅ Casino initialized!
🎉 Success! Casino is ready to accept bets!
```

---

### Phase 7: Fund the Vault (1 minute)

```bash
node scripts/fund-vault.js
```

**Expected output:**
```
💰 Funding Casino Vault...
✅ Connected to devnet  
📊 Current vault balance: 0 SOL
💸 Funding vault with 2 SOL...
✅ Vault funded!
📊 New vault balance: 2 SOL
🎉 Success! Vault is ready to pay winners!
```

---

### Phase 8: TEST IT! (The Fun Part! 🎉)

```bash
# Start your app
npm run dev

# Open browser: http://localhost:5174
```

#### Test Steps:

1. **Connect Wallet**

   - Select your wallet (Phantom/Solflare)
   - Approve connection
   - You should see your balance!

2. **Go to Games**

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "solana: command not found"
**Solution:** Restart terminal, or add to PATH manually
